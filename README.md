# Organ Donation and Transplant Management System

This project is a **blockchain-integrated platform** designed to streamline and secure the organ donation and transplant process. It connects **donors**, **recipients**, and **hospitals**, ensuring transparency and efficiency. The system leverages **MongoDB** for fast and easy data access while storing critical data on the blockchain for security and immutability. **MetaMask is not required** for most user interactions, making the platform accessible to a wider audience.

## Implementation Details

### Donor Registration

Donors need to enter their details like name, email, password, gender, blood group, city, organ.

![donor_signup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da6a7b9f-b95c-4413-acc8-991a19d3727f)

### Hospital Login

Hospitals can login with their unique credentials.

![hospital_login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5756772-e621-468b-9a9b-6b3b88c7eba4)

### Approve Donor

Hospitals need to verify the Donor using his/her aadhar number and email.
Now, Donor details will be stored in Blockchain and also updated in MongoDB database.

![approve_donor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/233d9713-818f-4b93-aba5-5d2e509ec58c)

### Recipient Registration

Hospitals need to register details of recipient by giving their demographic details and bloodgroup, organ details.
Now, Recipient details will be stored in Blockchain and also updated in MongoDB database.

### Transplant Match

Hospitals can do transplant match to find matching donors for recipients. 
Transplant match details will also be stored in Blockchain and updated in MongoDB database.
